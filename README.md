# React Project Management Web App ðŸ–Š
Focus on: 
- [x] Build, Style, Configure & Re-use **`Components`**.
- [x] Manage **`State`**.
- [x] Access DOM Elements & Browser APIs with **`Refs`**.
- [x] Manage JSX Rendering Positions with **`Portals`**.

# ðŸ“‹ Work flow for building project managment app:
1. Create **component** folder.

2. Add `ProjectSidebar` component
   * Inside create `<aside>` element.
   * Styling the Sidebar & Button with Tailwind CSS.

3. Add `NewProject` component for gathering all project data.
   * Creating 3 `<input>` elements for **Title, Description, and Due Date.**

4. Because they look the same, Add reusable `Input` component.
   * Inside adding `<label>, <textarea>, and {...props}`.
   * After that adding tailwind classes.

5. Add `<ProjectSidebar/>` and `<NewProject/>` to App.jsx.
* By hover over tailwind classes, I can see the styles that are applied to the elements.

For now the app looks like this:

6. Split components: Creating a new component: `NoProjectSelected` to display when no project is selected.
  * First, Create `<img>, <h2>, <p>, and <button>` elements.
  * Then, add the styling for each.
Looks like this:

7. Create a `Button.jsx` component to use in multiple places, to avoid repeating the same code.
  * The content should be flexible and passed as `children`. Button should collect all other `...props` that might be set, and then spread them on the button element. So later we can add for example the `onChange` prop.

8. Inside App: Add `NoProjectSelected`, but render `NewProject`, or `NoProjectSelected`, depending if the button got clicked or not. Therefore, add `state` to manage this situation.
  * New state is an object include: `property`; to indicate if project is new or not existence, and `array`; for all the projects.
  * Then render the corresponding component conditionally.
    
9. Add and pass `handleStartAddProject` function to `onStartAddProject` prop with `<NoProjectSelected>`, and `<ProjectsSidebar>` component (that contain button for adding new project).
  * Inside each component (`NoProjectSelected`, and `ProjectsSidebar`), accept and destructure the prop `onStartAddProject` from App (that connect to `handleStartAddProject` function).
  * Then add `onStartAddProject` prop, to `onCilck` prop in Button.
    
10. Next step is to collect the user input and validate them.
    * We can do it with `onChange` prop inside <input>. But here i want to only read the values when i click save button. I don't want to manage all those extra states.
    * Instead i use **Ref**. To connect them to HTML elements and then interact with those elements. (retrieve the value from an input).

11. Validate user input & showing error `Modal` via `useImperativeHandle`;
  * Valaidate input fields, and Show the error modal in `<NewProject>`.
  * Create `Modal` component, and return built in `<dialog>`.
  * Wrap it in `forwardRef`, extract the `children` and `buttonCaption` properties.
  * `children` (from props object), makes this component flexible. `children` is pass to every component, so I can use `Modal` as a wrapper to any content I want. And that content will be wrapped by the `dialog` element.
  * Add a `ref`.
  * Add `useImperativeHandle`, defining `open` function. To expose a function that can be called from outside the component.
  * Inside, pass it a ref object and a function that returns an object.
  * Inside open, I want to call `showModal` method on the dialog element. I do it with useRef named `dialog`.

12. Styling `Modal` via tailwind - add styles to dialog, and form, and use the Button component.
  * Text style is changed in `NewProject.jsx`.

13. Add Cancel option to **New Project** screen;
    * When clicking *cancel* button, the user will go back to home screen.
    * Inside App: Add `handleCancelAddProject` function for cancel the creation of new project. (Same code as `handleStartAddProject` function, but selectedProjectId is set to undefined instaed of null).
   * Render `<NewProject>` with `onCancel={handleCancelAddProject}`.
   * Inside `NewProject.jsx` -  accept `onCancel` prop.
   * Make sure `onCancel` connected to cancel button.

14. Making projects selectebale & viewing project details:
     * Create `SelectedProject` component, return `<header>`, `<h1>`, and `<button>`.
     * Expect to get `project` prop.
     * Format `project.dueDate`.
     *  Add style via tailwind 


15. Handling Project Deletion

16. Adding "Project Tasks" & A Tasks Component

17. Managing Tasks & Understanding Prop Drilling

19. Clearing Tasks & Fixing Minor Bugs
